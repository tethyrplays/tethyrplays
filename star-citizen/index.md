**The United Empire of Earth** is the beating heart of Humanity in the 30th century that spans across dozens of systems, worlds and moons. Imagine a universe that combines the freedom of exploration, the thrill of combat, and the unique challenge of building a life in space.

Star Citizen puts ultimate control in the hands of the player.

Soar through the stars. Fight. Trade. Unite. Explore. With the freedom [to choose from over 80 vehicles](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/ships), what kind of experience a pilot has will be affected by the type of ship they select to fly through the depths of space.
