The UEE is the beating heart of Humanity in the 30th century. Imagine a universe that combines the freedom of exploration, the thrill of combat, and the unique challenge of building a life in space.

Star Citizen puts ultimate control in the hands of the player.

Soar through the stars. Fight. Trade. Unite. Explore. With the freedom to choose from dozens of vehicles, what kind of experience a pilot has will be affected by the type of ship they select to fly through the depths of space.

While Star Citizen is currently in the Alpha stage of development, it is playable now. Sign-up for a free Star Citizen account with the referral code to earn a bonus 5000 in-game currency.
