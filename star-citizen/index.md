### JOIN THE VERSE

# Star Citizen

The UEE is the beating heart of Humanity in the 30th century. Imagine a universe that combines the freedom of exploration, the thrill of combat, and the unique challenge of building a life in space.

Star Citizen puts ultimate control in the hands of the player.

Soar through the stars. Fight. Trade. Unite. Explore. With the freedom to choose from dozens of vehicles, what kind of experience a pilot has will be affected by the type of ship they select to fly through the depths of space.
