## The Story So Far (or TL;DR)

The adventurers infiltrate a nearby Cragmaw lair, fighting through waves of goblins, to rescue Sildar Hallwinter of the Lord's Alliance, and confront the tribal chief bugbear Klarg in hopes of learning where the captured dwarf Gundren Rockseeker has been taken. Asher, having sustained critical injuries in the most recent melee, must rest before the party can move further into the cavern.

## Session 2 Recap

**Participants:** Gar, Asher, Aarden, Tarkin.

**Level 1 continued.**

**Inspiration.** 1 point of inspiration to Aarden. Inspiration allows a player to re-roll a dice, as long as its done before a result is called.

**Tarkin Awakens.** Tarkin, a Halfling Rogue, regains consciousness, hears voices beyond the thicket of brush, and stumbles out. After brief defensive posturing, a roughed up Tarkin explains that he was onset by goblins - the very goblins that are now dead. Gar invites Tarkin to join the group if he's willing to lend his skillset to their cause.

**Hexcrawl to Cragmaw.** (Map change: Neverwinter coastal region.) The party collects the wagon of supplies and continues on to locate the Cragmaw's cavern lair, crossing the flat-lands in a south-easterly direction, with the Neverwinter Wood in the background.

Aarden leads the wagon, Gar and Asher drive the oxen, with Tarkin at the rear.

[DM asks players to go into the Roll20 settings to change their Display Name to match their characters.]

Along the way Aarden uncovers what appears to be a hidden trap. Investigation(13) reveals leaves crudely concealing a snare. Tarkin comes around, noting that the rope snare would have grabbed Aarden, the front-runner, and disarms it with his weapon. "EZ-peezy, lemon-squeezy," he quips.

Aarden continues to lead the group and comes across another poorly hidden trap. Tarkin's Perception(15) allows him to warn the wagon clear of the pit trap.

**Outside the Cragmaw Lair.** (Map change: Outside Cragmaw cavern.) Tracking the goblin's trail for about 5 miles, the party arrives outside a cavern. A shallow stream flows from its mouth and briar thickets dot both sides.

Gar insists on taking the lead against any goblinoids inside, preferring to soak damage while the party engages in a ranged assault; Asher recommends investigating the area first.

Tarkin stealthily moves to scout the surrounding area near the entrance. Toward the eastern side, two goblins pay little attention to their duties from a makeshift lookout post; one on ground-level, inattentively picking his nose and flicking it; the other hanging from a tree.

As Tarkin moves forward closer to the entrance, the tree goblin calls out, "Hey, I see something! There's a human there!" The goblin then drops from the tree, and both rush to attack.

**Combat Encounter.** [Goblin x2]

> Initiative: Tarkin, Asher, Goblin-1 (tree), Goblin-2 (ground), Aarden, Gar

Tarkin fires an arrow with the shortbow at the tree goblin- 17 ATK for 6 piercing DMG -then moves to Hide in the thicket. Asher moves into the thicket too and readies an Eldritch Blast, but misses- 13 ATK. The goblin hops out of the way, taunting Asher, then fires an arrow at Tarkin- 20 ATK for 4 piercing DMG -before fleeing into the cavern.

Aarden moves into the shallow stream and fires an arrow with the longbow. The tree goblin has +2 AC within partial cover of the cavern- 17 ATK for 4 piercing DMG. The arrow kills the goblin.

[Goblin-1 Dead.]

The ground goblin moves toward the entrance and fires an arrow for a _Critical Hit_ at Asher in the thicket- 20 ATK for 9 piercing damage -then also flees into the cavern.

Gar runs to the entrance and readies a defensive posture. Tarkin bemoans his injury, moves toward the goblin, and fires an arrow for a fatal headshot - 19 ATK for 9 piercing DMG.

[Goblin-2 Dead.]

**What the Mage Hand of Healing?!** Possibly due to a magical flub caused by his injuries, a mage hand briefly appears near Asher, then vanishes, as he casts Healing Word for +6 HP.

**Here There Be Wolves.** Entering the cavern, Aarden walks over the two goblin corpses to find an adjoining chamber. From within the chamber is the sound of snarling and the clatter of chains. Two wolves, and another out of sight, are chained with iron rods to stalagmites. The wolves are snarling and barking but no one appears to be responding to the noise.

The two dead goblins, if not intercepted, appear to have been heading to unleash the wolves.

Asher appears relieved upon confirmation that the wolves are securely chained and out of reach. Gar observes that the stream is elevated slightly more than outside, covering his ankles. Tarkin stands as a lookout from within the cavern corridor, noting that all is quiet except the wolves. Asher quickly checks the sentry outpost for any supplies, but finds none.

**Loot Goblins.** Aarden inspects the dead goblins and finds 7 arrows. [3 for Aarden; 4 for Tarkin.]

**Calming the Wolves.** [Wolf x3] Aarden cautiously enters the adjoining chamber and wants to calm the emaciated wolves, so he decides to feed one of the goblin corpses to them. [12+4 Animal Handling] 10 minutes later the wolves are satisfied and allow the party to walk around the chamber.

[12+4 Perception] In the back area is a fissure through which Aarden can hear goblins talking, but no one is able to determine what they're saying. [No one speaks Goblin.] Tarkin notes that the voice beyond the fissure sounds aggressive compared to the typical goblins encountered thus far.

Gar attempts to feed a ration to the satiated wolves, but they appear uninterested in the gesture. Asher encourages everyone that its time to move on, but defensively stays behind the group.

**Exploring the Cavern.** [Darkvision check. Yes: Gar & Asher] Tarkin notes that the cavern is too dark beyond the entry way and has concerns that lighting a torch might draw attention. Asher is clear that he won't lead, but offers to cast a spell of illumination on another party member.

Gar brags that women love the scars he has accrued thus far, appearing eager to add more, and moves to scout 30 feet ahead of the group.

There's a path to the west, but Gar continues to push forward, following the path of the stream. As he gets further, he passes under a wooden bridge about 20 ft above him, and continues on into a chamber where he's immediately attacked by another goblin. 15 ATK for 4 piercing DMG.

The goblin yells, "Be gone intruder! We heard you!"

**Combat Encounter.** [Goblin x4.]

> Initiative: Tarkin, Goblin-1, Gar, Goblin-2, Asher, Goblin-3, Aarden, Goblin-4
> Tarkin used Lucky trait to re-roll.

Goblin-3 is closest to the party and moves into view on the bridge above.

Gar moves a bit eastward to engage the nearest goblin. Gar lands a killing blow to  Goblin-1 with his greataxe- 15 ATK for 9 slashing DMG -then moves adjacent to Goblin-2, while calling out to his companions, "Watch for the bridge!"

[Goblin-1 Dead.]

Asher moves up through the ankle-deep stream and attempts to Eldritch blast Goblin-3 on the bridge, but misses- 12 ATK -and moves back closer to the wolf chamber.

Goblin-4 moves onto the bridge, also from out of view, and nimbly hops down a scimitar in hand. Aarden backs up closer to the entrance, fires his longbow and misses- 12 ATK -then takes half-cover beyond the entrance.

Goblin-2 takes a double-attack on Gar with his scimitar. One hit, one miss. 21 ATK for 3 slashing DMG.

Tarkin fires his shortbow- 18 ATK for 4 piercing DMG -and bloodies the Goblin-4, then  moves to Hide. [12+7 Stealth]

Goblin-3 jumps down and slashes Asher. 15 ATK for 5 slashing DMG.

Gar rages and kills Goblin-2 with his greataxe- 23 ATK for 13 slashing DMG. Gar moves swiftly back to the bridge, jumps down and tumbles into a roll. [6 Acrobatics: takes 2 DMG]

[Goblin-2 Dead.]

Asher disengages from Goblin-3 and exits the cavern, avoiding an opportunity attack.

Goblin-4 turns back to attack Gar, slashing him with the scimitar- 18 ATK for 8 slashing DMG. Gar takes half DMG: 4.

Aarden bloodies Goblin-3 with a piercing arrow from his longbow, then repositions to draw the goblin's attention- 23 ATK for 5 piercing DMG. (Used Initiative to re-roll.)

Tarkin drops his shortbow and sneak attacks Goblin-3, missing with his shortsword- 11 ATK -but pierces the goblin's neck with his dagger, killing it. 19 ATK for 7 piercing DMG + 5 Sneak.

[Goblin-3 Dead.]

Gar decapitates Goblin-4 and victoriously showcases his kill to the party- 21 ATK for 9 slashing DMG.

[Goblin-4 Dead.]

Tarkin -- don't forget to pick up your shortbow next session.

**Pro DM Tip**
* Next Session: Asher could use a short rest to recover from his injuries, as he only has 2 HP left.

**Additional Notes**
* Remember to click on Character Token in Roll20 before rolling for Initiative; to automatically be added to Turn Order list.
* Mention any Resistances your character has during combat as you sustain injuries, as the DM may not be aware.
* Tarkin/Rogue: There's a Feat called "Dual Wielder" that allows adding Proficiency bonus to second attack, for future reference.

## Session 1 Recap

**Participants:** Gar, Asher, Aarden. **Absent:** Tarkin.

**Level 1.**

**Travel By Oxen and Wagon.** The party is underway for two days from Neverwinter escorting supplies destined for Barthon's Provisions in the remote town of Phandalin. Their employer, Gundren Rockseeker, and his trusted escort went ahead on horseback to attend to another task.

Asher and Aarden helm the reins of the oxen; Gar rides in the wagon with the supplies. After brief introductions, Asher & Aarden discuss the escort mission as Gar rummages through the supplies to determine what the group is transporting.

**Introductions.** Asher is a researcher engrossed in the study of Fey magic. Aarden is tracking down a trio of tribes-people that have gone missing, with Gundren's note as his only lead. Gar has been tasked on behalf of his blacksmithing guild.

**Fail Stealth Check.** Gar discovers ale amongst the wagon's mining and farming supplies and attempts to imbibe some without being noticed. The attempt fails with both Asher & Aarden staring at him in disbelief; Gar persists as if he'd gone unnoticed.

**Investigation.** The party reaches a 3-way intersection connecting to Triboar Trail. North returns to the city-state of Neverwinter; east continues to Phandalin; and south to Leilon. Two dead horses block the path to Phandalin. The party maneuvers the wagon to the side of the road and disembark to investigate.

Several feet before the horses, splintered planks serve as a makeshift bridge for a tiny brook that passes by the intersection. Trees line both sides of the bridge, obscuring any sign of the impending goblin ambush.

**Combat Encounter.** Four goblins ambush the party with surprise. Gar is flanked by two goblins and takes 3/4 damage from both. Asher moves out of melee range and manages to cast Sleep on the other two. Aarden tries to repeatedly sharpshoot his targets from range and misses.

Gar breaks into a rage with his greataxe, cleaving both of his attackers to death; the latter goblin is severed brutally. Asher vaporizes the third with an Eldritch blast. Gar's proximity to the blast covers him in goblin remains. Aarden uses hemp rope to restrain the final sleeping goblin for interrogation.

**Interrogation.** Intimidated by Gar, the goblin divulges his name is Krag. Aarden meanwhile is in a fit, abusing his bow, over its dreadful aim throughout the encounter.

Krag says the horses were killed in an earlier ambush by other members of his tribe, the Cragmaws. A dwarf and human were captured and taken to their tribal chief, a bugbear named Klarg.

The goblins have been on the lookout for the dwarf under orders of King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw Tribe. The King is allied with a mysterious benefactor, known only to the goblins as "the black spider." The black spider wants to to acquire the dwarf and his map to an old, lost mine.

Krag doesn't know the location of King Grol, but points the party to his own lair, a cavern, about 1-2 hours beyond the brook. Asked to lead the way, he refuses, stating his goblin peers would kill him for certain, even if the party survived.

Krag, in hopes that his life will be spared, divulges to the party that the human is being held by Klarg, but the dwarf and his map are already underway to King Grol.

Aarden's examination of the dead horses reveals an empty map pouch, corroborating the goblin's claim.

The party decides to locate the nearby Cragmaw cavern, rescue the captive and determine if the bugbear knows where their employer has been taken.

**Krag's Fate.** Asher and Aarden decide that Gar, having sustained the most injuries and kills, can decide Krag's fate. Aarden suggests leaving him tied in the brush. Gar and Asher are more concerned the goblin will interfere in the rescue attempt. Gar impales Krag quickly with a javelin after much begging and pleading for mercy. A distraught Aarden reclaims his bloodied rope.

**Encounter Loot.** The party distributes the loot from the goblins. 15 gold, 8 silver total.

**Short Rest (1 of 2).** The party takes a short rest for Gar to recover from his injuries and Asher to regain his spell slots.

**Important NPCs**
- **Gundren Rockseeker.** Captive. Hired the party to escort supplies to Barthon's Provisions. Location unknown.
- **Sildar Hallwinter.** Captive. Member of the Lord's Alliance and Gundren's protector.
- **Krag.** Dead. Minor goblin interrogated for information about ambush and captives.
- **Klarg.** Bugbear chief of the local Cragmaw goblins hiding in nearby cavern.
- **King Grol.** Leader of the Cragmaws. Location unknown. Allied with "The Black Spider."

**Additional Notes**
- Players must keep track of loot distribution and update their own character sheet accordingly.
- Players are only permitted 2 short rests per 24 hour period / long rest.
- XP will be evenly distributed to all players, including absent, to avoid mixed-level characters that will complicate encounters.

## Campaign Plot

<i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i> [D&D Starter Set: Lost Mine of Phandelver](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_starterset)

More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power.

Then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.

For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine.

In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town and the Rockseeker brothers — a trio of dwarves — believe they have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave.
