## Session 6 Recap

**Participants:** Asher, Aarden, Tarkin, Gesgrim, Gar, Andral.

**Level 2 continued.** **Inspiration.** 1 point to Tarkin.

**Stonehill Inn.** After a full nights rest the party meets up in the quiet common area of the inn to speak with the proprietor, Toblin Stonehill, about any rumours of goblin activity in the region. He hadn't heard anything, but suggests speaking to Sister Garaele at the shrine.

**Shrine of Luck.** Andral greets Sister Garaele and asks if she knows of any castles in the region where goblins might have taken refuge. She marks two potential locations on the party's map that might be of interest. Garaele then turns the discussion to the local troubles with the Redbrand, and inquires if the party might clear them out. She indicates they may be held up at the abandoned Tresendar Manor up the hill, but has no idea how many they number.

**Smithy & Barthen's.** Lodging his knife into the smith's counter, Gar greets the man working there. The man disapprovingly removes the weapon and asks what he can do for him. The smith doesn't recognize the craftmanship of the jade statue in Gar's possession and recommends checking with Barthan's.

Gar then asks about Tresendar Manor. The smith recounts that the manor was abandoned after a natural disaster some 500 years ago; and to his knowledge, no one lives in the ruins. Gar thanks the smith with coin, then makes a quick stop at Barthen's to sell the Jade Frog Statue and gather a few provisions.

[Jade Frog Statue: 35g. Divided between party: 6g each; 5g for Gar.]

**[===Session Break===]**

**Tresendar Manor.** The party travels through town to reach the manor. As Tarkin checks the surroundings [Survival: 7], Andral tries the manor's front door. Although it's blocked by rubble, Andral spots a broken wall with a staircase. The stone stairs lead to a cellar room lined with barrels and a cistern filled with fresh water.

Tarkin finds a hidden passage. [Investigation: 20] Andral is the first to go in and immediately falls 20 ft. into a pit trap. [Athletics: 4. Damage: 10] Using rope, Andral is pulled out of the pit. Gar then improvises a platform with rope and poles for everyone to cross the gap. [Requires 10 minutes.]

Aarden checks the other door in the room while waiting, but is unable to hear anything more than rats scurrying about. [Perception: 15.] Gesgrim inspects the barrels and notices that the contents are recent, confirming that the old manor is in use. Gar hears that the containers have salted meat and asks Gesgrim to gather some for the group. Gesgrim then inspects the cistern and finds a hidden satchel in the water. [History: 20.] Tarkin checks for any indications that the supplies are stolen, like markings for Barthen's, but finds none.

[Satchel with: potion of healing (2d4+2), potion of invisibility, 50 gp, and a clean set of ordinary travel clothing. Divided between party: 8g each. 9g for Andral & Gar.]

Andral takes the potion to recover from the fall. [HP: +7] Asher casts False Life on himself. [+7 Temp HP] . Gar tosses the invisibility potion to Tarkin.

Making their way across the platform, the party comes across a long hallway covered in thick dust, with faux columns every 10 feet, and a set of double doors with an angel carving at the end. Andral, Aarden and Gar fall into another pit trap. [Damage: 5] Gesgrim walks back to grab the rope-platform and helps the fallen party members out.

[XP: +20 each for surviving the pit trap.]

The next room is a dusty crypt with three large stone sarcophagi. Propped against each sarcophagus is a human skeleton in rusty mail armor. False columns line the room, carved in the image of spreading oak trees. Aarden immediately tries to spot any traps, but finds none. [Investigation: 11] Gar isn't able to identify any markings on the armor worn by the corpses; age has worn away any distinctive features. [Investigation: 11] Gesgrim then approaches one of the sarcophagi to inspect it and the skeletons chitter to life.

**Combat Encounter.** Initiative: Tarkin: 17, Tarkin: 9, Gesgrim: 8, Asher: 7, Gar: 7, Aarden: 5, Andral: 5

Tarkin lunges at Skeleton-1, piercing it with his shortsword, then disengages out of range. [21 ATK. 12 DMG. Piercing.]

Skeleton-3 and Skeleton-2 attack Andral, but he deflects their blows. [Miss.] Skeleton-1 slices into Gesgrim's shoulder. [3 DMG.] Gesgrim utters a divine word and a radiant, burning light burns Skeleton-1 and Skeleton-2. [6 DMG. Radiant. DC13 CON Save.] [Skeleton-1 Dead.]

Asher waves a hand and an Eldritch blast slams into Skeleton-2. [15 ATK. 11 DMG. Force.] [Skeleton-2 Dead.]

Gar makes a Reckless Attack with his greataxe at Skeleton-3. [23 ATK. 7 DMG. Slashing.] An arrow from Aarden's longbow finishes Skeleton-3. [20 ATK. 11 DMG. Piercing.]

**Too Much Noise!** As the fight ends, a door swings open, and a Redbrand demands to know what they're doing in the crypt. The party confronts him directly regarding the troubles in town and demand to speak with the group's leader. The guard laughs and refuses. Gar steps in front of the Redbrand and warns him that the other option is conflict, citing the dispatched skeletons. [Intimidation: 20] Taking a step back, intimidated, the guard draws his weapon...

**Combat Encounter.** Initiative: Tarkin: 20, Gesgrim: 17, Andral: 14, Gar: 11, Asher: 10, Aarden: 5.

## Session 5 Recap

**Participants:** Asher, Aarden, Tarkin, Gesgrim. **Absent:** Gar, Andral.

**Level 2.** **Inspiration.** 1 point to Aarden for recap.

The Party finishes a long rest at the Cragmaw cavern (to level up) before setting off to **Phandalin**. After a day of travel, they emerge from a wooded hillside, to a town of ~50 simple log buildings; some are built on old field-stone foundations while others rest near crumbling ruins. Crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars surround the newer houses and shops, showing how it must have been a much larger town in centuries past.

Townsfolk tend to chores and errands, while children play in the open grass areas. Many take notice of the newcomers, but immediately return to their own affairs. After gathering their bearings, the Party stops in at **Barthan's Provisions**, the largest trading post in town. A lean, balding human man introduces himself as the shopkeeper, and accepts delivery of the Party's supplies. **[Loot: 10g each.]**

After accepting their payment, the Party mentions additional supplies recovered from the goblins. Inspecting the supplies, the shopkeeper says that he was expecting those a day prior from Gundren himself. Aarden uncovers the body of Sildar for the shopkeeper to inspect, but he isn't able to identify the corpse. The Party explains they weren't able to locate Gundren and were hoping to get leads in town, asking about a castle that Klarg mentioned. The shopkeeper doesn't know of any. **[The shopkeeper indicates he'll pay Gundren for those supplies.]**

The shopkeeper recommends speaking to Harbin Wester at the **Townmaster's Hall** regarding the body; and Toblin Stonehill at the **Stonehill Inn** if he knows of any castles.

**Shopping.** PHB p150. Adventuring gear. The Party purchases 3 tents (capacity: 2 ppl per tent).

**A few notes...**
- Healer's Kit. PHB p151. 10 uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. Does not require proficiency. (See Healer feat to use the kit for healing too. PHB p167.)
- Ammunition. PHB p146. At the end of battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
- Encumberance. PHB p176. The carrying capacity of a character in lbs is Strength score multiplied by 15. Push, drag & lift is Strength score multiplied by 30 (twice the carrying capacity); speed drops to 5ft in excess of carrying capacity.

The shopkeeper takes the wagon-- Gar carries the tarped corpse-- as the Party continues on to the Townmaster's Hall. There's a graffiti'd notice board out front. Inside is clean and looks like a city hall. A heavy set, middle aged man, **Harbin Wester**, is seated at a table, taking notes on parchment paper as a woman complains about her property being defaced. He apologizes and indicates he'll have someone look into it, as well as send over someone to fix the damage.

**Townmaster's Hall.** Wester acknowledges the Party after the woman departs, introducing himself and asking what he can do for the adventurers. The party mentions their presence at the behest of Gundren. Wester indicates he hasn't seen Gundren in a few weeks and asks of his well being. The Party recaps the goblin encounters, then asks Wester if he's aware of any castles in the region.

**Wester says he'll ask around and offer the party any information he retrieves in 1 day.**

The party introduces themselves, then reveal the corpse for Wester to identify. After a moment he recognizes Sildar, offers his apologies over the man's death, and to take the corpse for the Lord's Alliance to claim. He arranges to pay the party using funds provided to the town by the Lord's Alliance.

(Gar drops the body in a very Orcish way.)

**Redbrand Ruffians.** Gesgrim notes that with the Party's duties fulfilled and Westin's request for a day to gather information, he'd like to find the nearest place of worship. Wester acknowledges that there is one; then interjects that he could use the Party's help for another matter. He asks the Party to investigate why a band of thugs - the Redbrand Ruffians - are harassing the townspeople and committing acts of thievery and graffiti.

Tarkin asks where the Redbrand come from, and Wester indicates that they are residents, but he doesn't know specifically who they are. Wester doesn't have a preference on what the Party does, just that he wants the menacing to stop or the Redbrand to be forced to leave. **Wester offers to pay 20g each once the Ruffians are dealt with.** He tells Tarkin that the Ruffians hang around the Sleeping Giant Inn.

DM: Due to interest in sidequests, the game will switch to the use of XP instead of milestones.

**[===Session Break===]**

The Party decides to head down to the **Sleeping Giant Inn** for a bite to eat and try to locate the ruffians.

The taphouse is rundown and dangerous looking, a watering hole and the end of Phandalin's main street. Those coming in and out looking rather thuggish, so it may be hard to tell the regular crowd apart from the Redbrand. Aarden ties the wolves up outside the tavern.

Inside the tavern there's a surely, attractive female dwarf behind the counter that calls out a greeting and tells the party to take a seat. The bar is dreary and rundown; the tables look like they've barely been cleaned. Crumbs cover the table that the Party sits at. A worker comes up, smiles and hands everyone a menu. The special is rabbit with leeks and potatoes, and a small side soup, for 3 silver. For drinks she suggests ale (2s), wine (3s) and coffee (1s).

Aarden strikes a finger across the table, holding up crumbs, and hesitantly asks, "You guys really want to eat here?" Gesgrim notes that the "appetizers" are already on the table -- and free. Each Party member orders. Aarden asks for coffee and notices she doesn't write down the request. Asher cleans the table using a Prestidigitation cantrip.

Tarkin looks around for any ruffians (Investigation: 24) and notices a table of four men that are wearing red scarves. The ruffians are acting generally thuggish at their table: leaning against barrels and tapping them; cat-calling women, and so on. The Party converses over what to do, and concludes they'll wait for the men to leave and follow them. Tarkin agrees to tail the ruffians should they leave, while the Party follows at a safe 30ft distance.

(Asher notes that a direct confrontation is likely to result in a bar fight and damage the party's standing in town.)

**Information gathering.** Gesgrim slides the waitress a gold piece and asks what she knows about the Redbrands. She looks toward the table that Tarkin hinted at and says that the Redbrand come in a lot. "They're always hanging around. Seems like we just leave them alone, they leave us alone. We provide them food and drink. Nothing more. There's plenty more of them. They have a base of operations in town somewhere, but that's just a rumor and might not be true." Gesgrim asks if there's a leader, but the waitress doesn't know of any. Aarden asks how long they've been here, and she says a few months. Aarden clarifies he wants to know how long the four have been inside the inn; she says they arrived about an hour ago.

The Party hangs around to eat and drink, while waiting for the ruffians to leave. The Redbrand stick around for quite a while, then decide to leave in a few hours. Tarkin follows them out a moment later, and the Party follows. Gesgrim [CON: 5], Asher [CON: 7] and Tarkin [CON: 11] are drunk: disadvantage on DEX checks, advantage on CHA checks. Tarkin becomes immediately reticent.

**Following the Redbrand.** Gesgrim casts Guidance on Tarkin (add 1d4 to any skill check), who then tries to stealthily follow the Redbrand through town. [Stealth Disadvantage: 27:9 + Guidance: 1] Aarden realizes that the Redbrand weren't drunk as they go. [Perception: 20]. As they reach an alleyway between some of the houses, one of the Ruffians spits on the ground and turns to Tarkin, "Well, well, look at this - little stray puppy. Have you come to bark at us?!"

Tarkin tries to slyly deceive the Ruffian, in a drunkinly manner saying that he's looking for nice stuff to steal. [Deception Advantage: 13:17]. The Ruffian says there isn't any "nice stuff" in Phandalin, as another Ruffian approaches to see what's going on. The Ruffian gives Tarkin the option to leave or fight.

Tarkin opts to walk away and the Ruffians laugh behind his back. Tarkin reiterates that he'd rather find a place to sleep than fight to the death. The party heads for **Stonehill Inn** (cost: 2s per night); Aarden opts to make arrangements with the woman that sought out the Townmaster earlier; and Gesgrim will take up lodge in a building that recognizes his guild affiliation.

## Session 4 Recap

**Participants:** Gar, Asher, Aarden, Tarkin, Gesgrim, Andral.

**Level 1 continued.** **Inspiration.** 1 point to Gar for recap.

The group discuss transporting Sildar Hallwinter's body back to Phandalin. At first, Gar shows no interest as he isn't the sentimental type; Asher "is out" if the corpse begins to stink; Gesgrim thinks that any kin of Hallwinter may hold the party in regard for the gesture.

**History: Hallwinter + Lord's Alliance.** Who's from the Sword Coast? No: Aarden, Tarkin, Gesgrim. ???: Asher, Gar. [DM Nicole recommends the "Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/marketplace/sourcebooks/sword-coast-adventurers-guide). Yes: Andral is from Neverwinter.

Andral: History check- 14. Sildar isn't anyone of importance to the Lord's Alliance, but the LA would be willing to pay for the recovery of their agents. The Lord's Alliance is a group of allied political powers that are concerned with mutual security and prosperity; members of the order ensure the safety of the cities and other settlements, by eliminating threats by any means while bringing honor and glory to their leaders and lands. Phandalin is not allied with the Lord's Alliance.

Gar's attitude completely changes at the mention of coin, and immediately hefts the body and places it near the entrance.

Andral wants to know why the Gar, Asher, Tarkin and Andral are in the cavern. Gar recounts to Gesgrim and Andral that their group was ambushed by goblins on the road and learned through interrogation that their financier (Gundren Rockseeker) had been captured, and they are there to find him before continuing to Phandalin. Andral asks if Gundren is in the cave. Aarden clarifies that they already know that Gundren has been moved to a different location, but the bugbear leader may have information on where.

[DM rules 'Favored Enemy: Beasts' will allow beasts to understand basic commands from the Ranger. Group quickly goes over the highlights of each of their class abilities.]

**Deeper into the cavern.** Andral suggests Tarkin stealthily scout 30 ft ahead. Tarkin: Stealth- 21. Andral volunteers to lead the rest of the group from a safe distance. Tarkin delves deeper into the cavern, crosses a bridge and happens upon a chamber with a waterfall that fills two large pools. The overflow drains out into the western end. Low field stone walls serve as damns, holding the water in. The noise of the waterfall echoes in the cavern, making it difficult to hear.

Loud, indistinguishable talking is coming from the southern end of the chamber, then the sound of footsteps can be heard approaching. A large bugbear having noticed the light, with hands on hips, says in Common, "Who dares defy Klarg?!" Andral asks to know if Klarg has their friend, but Klarg feigns ignorance. Aarden clarifies, "The dwarf." "Klarg won't tell you about the Castle, fools!"

Tarkin is visibly concerned about his own safety at such close quarters with the bugbear; Andral moves in menacingly  at Klarg.

**[==Session Break==]**

**Combat Encounter.** [Gesgrim reminds Andral and Gar that "Peace Domain: Emboldening Bond" is still active for another 5 minutes, allowing  1d4 per turn for any check.]

Initiative- Asher: 21, Gar: 21, Tarkin: 9, Aarden: 8, Andral: 7, Gesgrim: 4.

Asher unleashes an Eldritch Blast (ATK 12) that misses Klarg, striking the wall behind him. Gar dashes 30 ft into melee range from the rear of the chamber. Ripper, Klarg's wolf, moves in and fails to bite Andral, leaving only scratch marks. Tarkin tries to stab Klarg, but misses (ATK 13). Aarden fires an arrow at Klarg from his shortbow and it barely misses (ATK 15). Andral slashes at Ripper, missing (ATK 12), as his longsword scrapes against the wall.

Aarden's wolves move in closer. Only one wolf manages to get in melee range, biting (ATK 21, DMG 9), bloodying and knocking Ripper prone (STR Save: Fail).

Both goblins with swords retreat into the back of the adjoining chamber, taunting the group to follow.

Klarg slams his morningstar over Andral (DMG 11), then bellows in laughter. Gesgrim casts a guiding bolt and misses (ATK 13); he also fails to push Klarg with his telekinesis (STR Save: 21). Asher fails again to Eldritch blast Klarg (ATK 12), then repositions. Gar, emboldened, slashes into Klarg with his greataxe (ATK 18, DMG 11).

Both goblins continue to hang back in the cavern.

Ripper bites into Gar (DMG 5), but is unable to knock him prone (STR Save: 11). Tarkin's shortsword pierces and bloodies Klarg (ATK 16, DMG 8, Sneak 1). "You will NOT defile Klarg!" the bugbear roars. A piercing arrow from Aarden's longbow slams Ripper into the wall, killing the wolf (ATK 23, DMG 9), as he turns to Klarg, imploring him to  "Surrender."

Klarg defiantly responds: "Klarg will NOT surrender throne to you."

Aarden: "We're not interested in your throne, we just want our friend, the dwarf."

Klarg grumbles: "You will not let Klarg live, even if Klarg told you where dwarf went. Is this not true? Klarg fight to the death. Klarg takes this information to the grave."

Andral slashes his longsword at Klarg (ATK 18, DMG 3), hitting him. Klarg, holding his stomach where he was sliced, starts to limp. Klarg manages to evade each of the wolves' attacks (ATK 6, 6 & 7); then the goblins rush forward, attacking the wolves. One wolf dies instantly from a critical hit.

"Don't like the stealthy ones!" Klarg yells as he strikes Tarkin unconcious. (CRIT. DMG 23. 0 HP) [DM overrides insta-death rule due to difficulty of early levels.]

At the sound of bones crunching, Gesgrim swiftly turns and casts Healing Word to revive Tarkin (+6 HP).

[DM rules that Goodberries are allowed for +1 HP after 3 successful death throws. Andral mentions he failed to use the 'Lucky' feature to trigger a re-roll for a previous round. Gesgrim and Andral totally don't discuss meta-gaming their tanks.]

Asher moves into range and casts Sleep, putting Klarg and the remaining goblins to sleep.

**Party interrogates Klarg and goblins.** After tying up and moving their attackers, Asher charms Klarg and one of the goblins with his Fey Presence. The uncharmed goblin squirms in his bonds and cries out, "How dare you?! How dare you tie me up?! Rude!"

"Klarg is sorry he threatened to make you into throne from your bones. What Klarg do for you?"

"I forgive you," Asher prods, "but tell us what happened to that dwarf, Gundren. We really need to find him."

"Klarg knows what happened to dwarf. Dwarf was taken away by the chief of Cragmaw castle. Don't know what he wants with him."

Asher: "Does the chief have a name?" Klarg: "Chief has a name. Grol." Asher: "Where is his castle?" Klarg: "Castle. Don't know where castle is." Klarg shakes his head. Asher: "What can you tell us about the Black Spider?"

Klarg: "Black Spider pay us to watchout for Gundren, the dwarf, and send him back to Grol. Klarg follow orders."

Asher: "If you sent him back, you must know where he is." Aarden: "If not you, then who?" Klarg: "The people who take him, of course." Aarden: "Do they come here regularly?" Klarg: "Mmm, sometimes. They leave few days ago. No come back since."

Asher: "What kind of creature is the black spider?" Klarg: "Klarg don't know. Klarg think bugbear? Klarg think hobgoblin? Hobgoblin. Big goblin. Ugly goblin. Goblin ugly; but hobgoblin really ugly."

Asher: "Klarg, you've been so helpful, but I just don't know if it's been helpful enough. What else could you tell us that would be helpful? That maybe we'd let you live. Anything? Do you have any treasure here, hidden in this cave?"

Andral recommends the party investigate the room.

Klarg squirms: "Klarg no able to reach pocket. Reach in Klarg pocket; take what Klarg have. Let Klarg go. Klarg no harm big people anymore."

Asher reaches into Klarg's pocket and finds a Frog Jade Statue with Gold Orb Eyes. Klarg: "Best possesion of Klarg," he beams in pride. "No kill Klarg. Stolen supplies: take back to Phandalin. Money in treasure chest. Let Klarg live."

Asher: "That's very helpful. We're just going to leave you tied up while we look around, but we'll let you live."

The party rummages through the goblin's stash, distribute loot, and haul the stolen provisions and Sildar's body to the wagon for transport to Phandalin. It's decided that the cavern is a safe place to take a (long) rest, as it is late and Phandalin is another day away and Gesgrim needs to recoup. Klarg and the goblins are sent on their way after (Aarden: Insight- 15) discerning that they won't cause further trouble for the group.

**Loot**

- Gar: Jade statue of a Frog w/Gold Orb Eyes, worth 40 gp
- Currency: 50 gp, 110 sp, 600 cp (Distributed: 8 gp; 18sp; 100 cp each)

## Session 3 Recap

**Participants:** Gar, Asher, Aarden, Tarkin, Gesgrim, Andral.

**Level 1 continued.** **Inspiration.** 1 point to Asher for recap.

**Perception check.** Tarkin: 22. Aarden: 19. Gar: 11. Asher: 4. The party hears the distant sound of more goblins coming from an eastern shaft of the lair, but they aren't an immediate threat.

**Short Rest.** Gar requests a moment to gather his strength. Tarkin drags the bodies of dead goblins into the wolves' den. The wolves pant happily.

`!short-rest` command: Informs players of damage received and remaining hit dice for recovery. Tarkin: -4 HP. Rest +4 HP. Gar: -10 HP. No Hit Dice. Aarden: Full HP. Asher: -8 HP. Rest +9 HP.

**Tarkin successfully scouts the eastern passage.** Tarkin- Stealth: 18. Navigating slowly through the passage, Tarkin gets a glimpse of a goblin ahead, and can hear a few more of them beyond, then doubles back to inform the others.

**Aarden befriends the wolves.** Aarden- Animal handling: 18. Aarden un-anchors the three wolves and leads them to the eastern passage. Tarkin realizes that his bow is missing and quickly retrieves it from outside the cavern.

With the wolves leading, the party makes it way into a large chamber that's divided in half by a 10ft escarpment. The goblins occupy the upper section and a natural stairway descends into the lower section, where the captives are tied up: a human, an aasimar and a dwarf.

The air is hazy with the smoke of a cooking fire in the corner and the pungent smell of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins. A pile of belongings rests all along the side of the wall.

 The goblins appear surprised by the intruders, and the captives see an opportunity to break free.

**Combat Encounter.** Initiative- Aarden: 23. Tarkin: 17. Gesgrim: 15. Asher: 10. Andral: 4. Gar: 3. (The captives are able to use a Str check during each turn to try to break free of their ropes, or a party member may cut them free.)

Aarden- Nature: 19. Reminded that the goblin Krag was able to speak common, Aarden takes the chance that the goblins are able to understand him. He demands their surrender and the release of a human captive. The goblin leader feigns there are lots of human prisoners in their possession and refuses to release any.

Aarden fires his longbow at the nearest goblin and misses. An arrow from Tarkin's shortbow follows (24 ATK), piercing the goblin's neck (9 DMG) and killing him.

Gesgrim attempts to break free of his bonds (Athletics: 1), but they tighten instead. In furstration, Gesgrim unleashes a telekinetic burst that pushes the leader back; he looks around confused by what just happened, as do his peers.

Two more goblins are mauled by the wolves, killing them. Asher enters the chamber and Eldritch blasts a goblin (15 ATK), who glares back at him (2 DMG). Andral tries to break free (Athletics: 8) but isn't able to; he notices that the roughed-up human appears in no condition to free himself either.

Gar, spotting the captives in the lower section, yells "Focus on the enemies and give me cover!" and dashes to reach them.

**[==Session Break==]**

Aarden warns the goblin leader, visibly sweating, that this is his last opportunity to surrender; he grumbles in response. Aarden fires another arrow at a nearby goblin (7 ATK) and misses.

"How dare you use our creatures against us!" one of the goblins cries, slashing at one of the wolves (3 DMG). Tarkin, seeing the wolf engaged with the goblin (+Sneak), fires his shortbow and also misses (9 ATK).

The goblin leader, sensing the fight isn't going his way, moves toward the human captive. In range, Gar attacks with opportunity, but fails to land a blow with his greataxe (8 ATK), as the leader slides behind the human and places a knife to man's throat.

Goblin leader: "Do what I ask or I will kill this man!"

Gesgrim, though restrained, forges an emboldening bond to Gar and Andral. (Two creatures w/in 30 ft; can target self. Add 1d4 to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw.)

The wolves flank and kill the two remaining goblins; then one wolf moves to Andral and chews through his bindings, releasing him.

Asher, moving into range: "What are you asking of us?"

Goblin leader: "I want you to kill our leader, the bugbear, and I will let you all go. I will all three of the prisoners and all of you go. If you kill the bugbear, Klarg. Kill Klarg." He's very frantic.

Aarden, pointing at all the dead goblins, says "By my math, I don't really think we we need your permission for anything anymore."

Goblin leader, holding up a whistle: "I have plenty more I can call."

Asher: "We're here to kill Klarg anyway, so work with us - help us."

Andral, freed from his bond, tackles the goblin leader (Athletics: 20), knocking him down and snatching the whistle. In the scuffle, Asher raises his hand (23 ATK) and the force of an Eldritch blast hits the goblin leader (7 DMG).

Gar moves to Gesgrim and lashes through the binding rope with his greataxe.

Aarden realizes he's had no success in appealing to the goblin leader to surrender and fires another longbow shot, missing (11 ATK). Tarkin also fails to land a hit with his shortbow (10 ATK).

Goblin leader: "Now you've done it! I'll kill him! I will!" (20 ATK. Critical.)

Gesgrim, watching the goblin leader slit the man's throat, dashes to grab his foci. The wolves, pacing menacingly, can't get in reach of the goblin leader, but stand ready to attack if he does. Asher's Eldritch blast misses (6 ATK).

Andral casts Lay on Hands on Gar (+5 HP) before retreating to recover his gear in the upper chamber.

Gar, emboldened (15 ATK), slams his greataxe into the goblin leader's head, then pushes him off.

**The Dead Human.** The fight over, the group introduces themselves to each other, before turning toward the dead human. "Poor bastard," Aarden sighs, appearing guilty about possibly having provoked the man's death. Kneeling next to the wolves, Aarden pets each in turn with affection for their help.

[The wolves are now members of the party.]

Gar thanks Andral for restoring his health, then asks the two strangers: "I'm curious to know about our fallen comrade. Did you know him?"

Gesgrim: "The last I remember was being hit on the head and then tied here with these other two." Gar: "You had not known him before? This is the first time you'd met him?" Gesgrim: "Yes, first time meeting everyone."

**Information.** Gar- Investigation: 19.

There is a **ring** and **a scroll** on the dead human that identifies him as Sildar Hallwinter, a member of the Lord's Alliance. Everyone knows that they are an alliance of political powers in the region that are concerned with the mutual security and prosperity of the Sword Coast region. [Like NATO.]

Gar also finds **a note** that indicates that Sildar was traveling with Gundren Rockseeker and a pouch with 50 gold.

Tarkin finds 22 gold + 12 silver among all the goblin corpses, and a small pouch with 3 gold teeth on the leader.

**Gar invites Gesgrim and Andral to the party.**

**Loot**
- Currency distribution: 12 gold + 2 silver each
- Gar: Pouch with 3 gold teeth
- Gar: Lord's Alliance ring and scroll

**Additional Notes**

- Can a player give their hit dice to another player? No.
- If **Prone**: melee attacks have advantage, ranged attacks have disadvantage.
- Meta knowledge: Wolves can pull a sled.
- Alternate non-combat tactic: Intimidation. Persuasion.

## Session 2 Recap

**Participants:** Gar, Asher, Aarden, Tarkin.

**Level 1 continued.** **Inspiration.** 1 point to Aarden for recap.

**Tarkin Awakens.** Tarkin, a Halfling Rogue, regains consciousness, hears voices beyond the thicket of brush, and stumbles out. After brief defensive posturing, a roughed up Tarkin explains that he was onset by goblins - the very goblins that are now dead. Gar invites Tarkin to join the group if he's willing to lend his skillset to their cause.

**Hexcrawl to Cragmaw.** (Map change: Neverwinter coastal region.) The party collects the wagon of supplies and continues on to locate the Cragmaw's cavern lair, crossing the flat-lands in a south-easterly direction, with the Neverwinter Wood in the background.

Aarden leads the wagon, Gar and Asher drive the oxen, with Tarkin at the rear.

[DM asks players to go into the Roll20 settings to change their Display Name to match their characters.]

Along the way Aarden uncovers what appears to be a hidden trap. Investigation(13) reveals leaves crudely concealing a snare. Tarkin comes around, noting that the rope snare would have grabbed Aarden, the front-runner, and disarms it with his weapon. "EZ-peezy, lemon-squeezy," he quips.

Aarden continues to lead the group and comes across another poorly hidden trap. Tarkin's Perception(15) allows him to warn the wagon clear of the pit trap.

**Outside the Cragmaw Lair.** (Map change: Outside Cragmaw cavern.) Tracking the goblin's trail for about 5 miles, the party arrives outside a cavern. A shallow stream flows from its mouth and briar thickets dot both sides.

Gar insists on taking the lead against any goblinoids inside, preferring to soak damage while the party engages in a ranged assault; Asher recommends investigating the area first.

Tarkin stealthily moves to scout the surrounding area near the entrance. Toward the eastern side, two goblins pay little attention to their duties from a makeshift lookout post; one on ground-level, inattentively picking his nose and flicking it; the other hanging from a tree.

As Tarkin moves forward closer to the entrance, the tree goblin calls out, "Hey, I see something! There's a human there!" The goblin then drops from the tree, and both rush to attack.

**Combat Encounter.** [Goblin x2]

> Initiative: Tarkin, Asher, Goblin-1 (tree), Goblin-2 (ground), Aarden, Gar

Tarkin fires an arrow with the shortbow at the tree goblin- 17 ATK for 6 piercing DMG -then moves to Hide in the thicket. Asher moves into the thicket too and readies an Eldritch Blast, but misses- 13 ATK. The goblin hops out of the way, taunting Asher, then fires an arrow at Tarkin- 20 ATK for 4 piercing DMG -before fleeing into the cavern.

Aarden moves into the shallow stream and fires an arrow with the longbow. The tree goblin has +2 AC within partial cover of the cavern- 17 ATK for 4 piercing DMG. The arrow kills the goblin.

[Goblin-1 Dead.]

The ground goblin moves toward the entrance and fires an arrow for a _Critical Hit_ at Asher in the thicket- 20 ATK for 9 piercing damage -then also flees into the cavern.

Gar runs to the entrance and readies a defensive posture. Tarkin bemoans his injury, moves toward the goblin, and fires an arrow for a fatal headshot - 19 ATK for 9 piercing DMG.

[Goblin-2 Dead.]

**What the Mage Hand of Healing?!** Possibly due to a magical flub caused by his injuries, a mage hand briefly appears near Asher, then vanishes, as he casts Healing Word for +6 HP.

**Here There Be Wolves.** Entering the cavern, Aarden walks over the two goblin corpses to find an adjoining chamber. From within the chamber is the sound of snarling and the clatter of chains. Two wolves, and another out of sight, are chained with iron rods to stalagmites. The wolves are snarling and barking but no one appears to be responding to the noise.

The two dead goblins, if not intercepted, appear to have been heading to unleash the wolves.

Asher appears relieved upon confirmation that the wolves are securely chained and out of reach. Gar observes that the stream is elevated slightly more than outside, covering his ankles. Tarkin stands as a lookout from within the cavern corridor, noting that all is quiet except the wolves. Asher quickly checks the sentry outpost for any supplies, but finds none.

**Loot Goblins.** Aarden inspects the dead goblins and finds 7 arrows. [3 for Aarden; 4 for Tarkin.]

**Calming the Wolves.** [Wolf x3] Aarden cautiously enters the adjoining chamber and wants to calm the emaciated wolves, so he decides to feed one of the goblin corpses to them. [12+4 Animal Handling] 10 minutes later the wolves are satisfied and allow the party to walk around the chamber.

[12+4 Perception] In the back area is a fissure through which Aarden can hear goblins talking, but no one is able to determine what they're saying. [No one speaks Goblin.] Tarkin notes that the voice beyond the fissure sounds aggressive compared to the typical goblins encountered thus far.

Gar attempts to feed a ration to the satiated wolves, but they appear uninterested in the gesture. Asher encourages everyone that its time to move on, but defensively stays behind the group.

**Exploring the Cavern.** [Darkvision check. Yes: Gar & Asher] Tarkin notes that the cavern is too dark beyond the entry way and has concerns that lighting a torch might draw attention. Asher is clear that he won't lead, but offers to cast a spell of illumination on another party member.

Gar brags that women love the scars he has accrued thus far, appearing eager to add more, and moves to scout 30 feet ahead of the group.

There's a path to the west, but Gar continues to push forward, following the path of the stream. As he gets further, he passes under a wooden bridge about 20 ft above him, and continues on into a chamber where he's immediately attacked by another goblin. 15 ATK for 4 piercing DMG.

The goblin yells, "Be gone intruder! We heard you!"

**Combat Encounter.** [Goblin x4.]

> Initiative: Tarkin, Goblin-1, Gar, Goblin-2, Asher, Goblin-3, Aarden, Goblin-4
> Tarkin used Lucky trait to re-roll.

Goblin-3 is closest to the party and moves into view on the bridge above.

Gar moves a bit eastward to engage the nearest goblin. Gar lands a killing blow to  Goblin-1 with his greataxe- 15 ATK for 9 slashing DMG -then moves adjacent to Goblin-2, while calling out to his companions, "Watch for the bridge!"

[Goblin-1 Dead.]

Asher moves up through the ankle-deep stream and attempts to Eldritch blast Goblin-3 on the bridge, but misses- 12 ATK -and moves back closer to the wolf chamber.

Goblin-4 moves onto the bridge, also from out of view, and nimbly hops down a scimitar in hand. Aarden backs up closer to the entrance, fires his longbow and misses- 12 ATK -then takes half-cover beyond the entrance.

Goblin-2 takes a double-attack on Gar with his scimitar. One hit, one miss. 21 ATK for 3 slashing DMG.

Tarkin fires his shortbow- 18 ATK for 4 piercing DMG -and bloodies the Goblin-4, then  moves to Hide. [12+7 Stealth]

Goblin-3 jumps down and slashes Asher. 15 ATK for 5 slashing DMG.

Gar rages and kills Goblin-2 with his greataxe- 23 ATK for 13 slashing DMG. Gar moves swiftly back to the bridge, jumps down and tumbles into a roll. [6 Acrobatics: takes 2 DMG]

[Goblin-2 Dead.]

Asher disengages from Goblin-3 and exits the cavern, avoiding an opportunity attack.

Goblin-4 turns back to attack Gar, slashing him with the scimitar- 18 ATK for 8 slashing DMG. Gar takes half DMG: 4.

Aarden bloodies Goblin-3 with a piercing arrow from his longbow, then repositions to draw the goblin's attention- 23 ATK for 5 piercing DMG. (Used Initiative to re-roll.)

Tarkin drops his shortbow and sneak attacks Goblin-3, missing with his shortsword- 11 ATK -but pierces the goblin's neck with his dagger, killing it. 19 ATK for 7 piercing DMG + 5 Sneak.

[Goblin-3 Dead.]

Gar decapitates Goblin-4 and victoriously showcases his kill to the party- 21 ATK for 9 slashing DMG.

[Goblin-4 Dead.]

Tarkin -- don't forget to pick up your shortbow next session.

**Pro DM Tip**
* Next Session: Asher could use a short rest to recover from his injuries, as he only has 2 HP left.

**Additional Notes**
* Remember to click on Character Token in Roll20 before rolling for Initiative; to automatically be added to Turn Order list.
* Mention any Resistances your character has during combat as you sustain injuries, as the DM may not be aware.
* Tarkin/Rogue: There's a Feat called "Dual Wielder" that allows adding Proficiency bonus to second attack, for future reference.

## Session 1 Recap

**Participants:** Gar, Asher, Aarden. **Absent:** Tarkin.

**Level 1.**

**Travel By Oxen and Wagon.** The party is underway for two days from Neverwinter escorting supplies destined for Barthon's Provisions in the remote town of Phandalin. Their employer, Gundren Rockseeker, and his trusted escort went ahead on horseback to attend to another task.

Asher and Aarden helm the reins of the oxen; Gar rides in the wagon with the supplies. After brief introductions, Asher & Aarden discuss the escort mission as Gar rummages through the supplies to determine what the group is transporting.

**Introductions.** Asher is a researcher engrossed in the study of Fey magic. Aarden is tracking down a trio of tribes-people that have gone missing, with Gundren's note as his only lead. Gar has been tasked on behalf of his blacksmithing guild.

**Fail Stealth Check.** Gar discovers ale amongst the wagon's mining and farming supplies and attempts to imbibe some without being noticed. The attempt fails with both Asher & Aarden staring at him in disbelief; Gar persists as if he'd gone unnoticed.

**Investigation.** The party reaches a 3-way intersection connecting to Triboar Trail. North returns to the city-state of Neverwinter; east continues to Phandalin; and south to Leilon. Two dead horses block the path to Phandalin. The party maneuvers the wagon to the side of the road and disembark to investigate.

Several feet before the horses, splintered planks serve as a makeshift bridge for a tiny brook that passes by the intersection. Trees line both sides of the bridge, obscuring any sign of the impending goblin ambush.

**Combat Encounter.** Four goblins ambush the party with surprise. Gar is flanked by two goblins and takes 3/4 damage from both. Asher moves out of melee range and manages to cast Sleep on the other two. Aarden tries to repeatedly sharpshoot his targets from range and misses.

Gar breaks into a rage with his greataxe, cleaving both of his attackers to death; the latter goblin is severed brutally. Asher vaporizes the third with an Eldritch blast. Gar's proximity to the blast covers him in goblin remains. Aarden uses hemp rope to restrain the final sleeping goblin for interrogation.

**Interrogation.** Intimidated by Gar, the goblin divulges his name is Krag. Aarden meanwhile is in a fit, abusing his bow, over its dreadful aim throughout the encounter.

Krag says the horses were killed in an earlier ambush by other members of his tribe, the Cragmaws. A dwarf and human were captured and taken to their tribal chief, a bugbear named Klarg.

The goblins have been on the lookout for the dwarf under orders of King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw Tribe. The King is allied with a mysterious benefactor, known only to the goblins as "the black spider." The black spider wants to to acquire the dwarf and his map to an old, lost mine.

Krag doesn't know the location of King Grol, but points the party to his own lair, a cavern, about 1-2 hours beyond the brook. Asked to lead the way, he refuses, stating his goblin peers would kill him for certain, even if the party survived.

Krag, in hopes that his life will be spared, divulges to the party that the human is being held by Klarg, but the dwarf and his map are already underway to King Grol.

Aarden's examination of the dead horses reveals an empty map pouch, corroborating the goblin's claim.

The party decides to locate the nearby Cragmaw cavern, rescue the captive and determine if the bugbear knows where their employer has been taken.

**Krag's Fate.** Asher and Aarden decide that Gar, having sustained the most injuries and kills, can decide Krag's fate. Aarden suggests leaving him tied in the brush. Gar and Asher are more concerned the goblin will interfere in the rescue attempt. Gar impales Krag quickly with a javelin after much begging and pleading for mercy. A distraught Aarden reclaims his bloodied rope.

**Encounter Loot.** The party distributes the loot from the goblins. 15 gold, 8 silver total.

**Short Rest (1 of 2).** The party takes a short rest for Gar to recover from his injuries and Asher to regain his spell slots.

**Important NPCs**
- **Gundren Rockseeker.** Captive. Hired the party to escort supplies to Barthon's Provisions. Location unknown.
- **Sildar Hallwinter.** Captive. Member of the Lord's Alliance and Gundren's protector.
- **Krag.** Dead. Minor goblin interrogated for information about ambush and captives.
- **Klarg.** Bugbear chief of the local Cragmaw goblins hiding in nearby cavern.
- **King Grol.** Leader of the Cragmaws. Location unknown. Allied with "The Black Spider."

**Additional Notes**
- Players must keep track of loot distribution and update their own character sheet accordingly.
- Players are only permitted 2 short rests per 24 hour period / long rest.
- XP will be evenly distributed to all players, including absent, to avoid mixed-level characters that will complicate encounters.

## Campaign Plot

<i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i> [D&D Starter Set: Lost Mine of Phandelver](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_starterset)

More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power.

Then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.

For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine.

In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town and the Rockseeker brothers — a trio of dwarves — believe they have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave.
