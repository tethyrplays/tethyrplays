## Session 1 Recap

<i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i> Thursday, February 18, 2021 \| 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. PST

**Participants:** Gar, Asher, Aarden. **Absent:** Tarkin.

**Level 1.**

**Travel By Oxen and Wagon.** The party is underway for two days from Neverwinter escorting supplies destined for Barthon's Provisions in the remote town of Phandalin. Their employer, Gundren Rockseeker, and his trusted escort went ahead on horseback to attend to another task.

Asher and Aarden helm the reins of the oxen; Gar rides in the wagon with the supplies. After brief introductions, Asher & Aarden discuss the escort mission as Gar rummages through the supplies to determine what the group is transporting.

**Introductions.** Asher is a researcher engrossed in the study of Fey magic. Aarden is tracking down a trio of tribes-people that have gone missing, with Gundren's note as his only lead. Gar has been tasked on behalf of his blacksmithing guild.

**Fail Stealth Check.** Gar discovers ale amongst the wagon's mining and farming supplies and attempts to imbibe some without being noticed. The attempt fails with both Asher & Aarden staring at him in disbelief; Gar persists as if he'd gone unnoticed.

**Investigation.** The party reaches a 3-way intersection connecting to Triboar Trail. North returns to the city-state of Neverwinter; east continues to Phandalin; and south to Leilon. Two dead horses block the path to Phandalin. The party maneuvers the wagon to the side of the road and disembark to investigate.

Several feet before the horses, splintered planks serve as a makeshift bridge for a tiny brook that passes by the intersection. Trees line both sides of the bridge, obscuring any sign of the impending goblin ambush.

**Combat Encounter.** Four goblins ambush the party with surprise. Gar is flanked by two goblins and takes 3/4 damage from both. Asher moves out of melee range and manages to cast Sleep on the other two. Aarden tries to repeatedly sharpshoot his targets from range and misses.

Gar breaks into a rage with his greataxe, cleaving both of his attackers to death; the latter goblin is severed brutally. Asher vaporizes the third with an Eldritch blast. Gar's proximity to the blast covers him in goblin remains. Aarden uses hemp rope to restrain the final sleeping goblin for interrogation.

**Interrogation.** Intimidated by Gar, the goblin divulges his name is Krag. Aarden meanwhile is in a fit, abusing his bow, over its dreadful aim throughout the encounter.

Krag says the horses were killed in an earlier ambush by other members of his tribe, the Cragmaws. A dwarf and human were captured and taken to their tribal chief, a bugbear named Klarg.

The goblins have been on the lookout for the dwarf under orders of King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw Tribe. The King is allied with a mysterious benefactor, known only to the goblins as "the black spider." The black spider wants to to acquire the dwarf and his map to an old, lost mine.

Krag doesn't know the location of King Grol, but points the party to his own lair, a cavern, about 1-2 hours beyond the brook. Asked to lead the way, he refuses, stating his goblin peers would kill him for certain, even if the party survived.

Krag, in hopes that his life will be spared, divulges to the party that the human is being held by Klarg, but the dwarf and his map are already underway to King Grol.

Aarden's examination of the dead horses reveals an empty map pouch, corroborating the goblin's claim.

The party decides to locate the nearby Cragmaw cavern, rescue the captive and determine if the bugbear knows where their employer has been taken.

**Krag's Fate.** Asher and Aarden decide that Gar, having sustained the most injuries and kills, can decide Krag's fate. Aarden suggests leaving him tied in the brush. Gar and Asher are more concerned the goblin will interfere in the rescue attempt. Gar impales Krag quickly with a javelin after much begging and pleading for mercy. A distraught Aarden reclaims his bloodied rope.

**Encounter Loot.** The party distributes the loot from the goblins. 15 gold, 8 silver total.

**Short Rest (1 of 2).** The party takes a short rest for Gar to recover from his injuries and Asher to regain his spell slots.

**Important NPCs**
- **Gundren Rockseeker.** Captive. Hired the party to escort supplies to Barthon's Provisions. Location unknown.
- **Sildar Hallwinter.** Captive. Member of the Lord's Alliance and Gundren's protector.
- **Krag.** Dead. Minor goblin interrogated for information about ambush and captives.
- **Klarg.** Bugbear chief of the local Cragmaw goblins hiding in nearby cavern.
- **King Grol.** Leader of the Cragmaws. Location unknown. Allied with "The Black Spider."

**Additional Notes**
- Players must keep track of loot distribution and update their own character sheet accordingly.
- Players are only permitted 2 short rests in a 24 hour period.
- XP will be evenly distributed to all players, including absent, to avoid mixed-level characters that will complicate encounters.

## Campaign Plot

More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power.

Then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.

For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine.

In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town and the Rockseeker brothers — a trio of dwarves — believe they have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave.
