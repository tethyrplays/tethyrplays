## Session 1 Recap
_Feb. 18, 2021 @ 12:30 to 2:30 PM_

**[Participants:](#session-0-recap)** Gar, Asher, Aarden. **Absent:** Tarkin, Joe.

**Travel:** The party travels from Neverwinter by wagon for approx. 2 days, first south along The High Road, then east on Triboar Trail, headed for Barthon's Provisions in Phandalin to deliver supplies. Their employer, Gundren Rockseeker, and his protector, Sildar Hallwinter, left earlier on another errand.

Asher and Aarden helm the reins of the oxen pulling the wagon; Gar rides in the wagon with the supplies. After brief introductions, Asher & Aarden discuss the escort mission as Gar rummages through the supplies to determine what the group is transporting.

**Introductions:** Asher is a researcher engrossed in the study of Fey magic. Aarden is tracking down a trio of tribes-people that have gone missing; Gundren's note is his only lead and he's trying to determine the connection. Gar has been assigned to escort the supplies on behalf of his blacksmithing guild.

**#Fail Stealth Check:** Gar discovers ale amongst the wagon's mining and farming supplies and attempts to imbibe some without being noticed by his companions up front. The attempt fails with both Asher & Aaden staring at him in disbelief; Gar persists as if he'd gone unnoticed.

**Investigation:** The party reaches a 3-way intersection. West returns to the city-state of Neverwinter; east continues to Phandalin; and south to Leilon. Two dead horses block the path to Phandalin. The party maneuvers the wagon off to the side of the road and disembark to investigate. Several feet before the horses, splintered planks serve as a makeshift bridge for a tiny brook that passes by the intersection. Trees line both sides of the bridge, obscuring any sign of the impending goblin ambush.

**Combat Encounter:** Four goblins ambush the party with surprise. Gar is flanked by two goblins and takes 3/4 damage from both. Asher moves out of melee range and manages to cast Sleep on the other two. Aarden tries to repeatedly Sharpshoot from range and misses 3x. Gar breaks into a rage with his greataxe, cleaving both of his attackers; the latter goblin is severed viscerally. Asher vaporizes the third with an Eldritch blast, covering Gar in its remains. Aarden uses hemp rope to restrain the final sleeping goblin for interrogation.

**Interrogation:** Intimidated by Gar, the goblin divulges his name is Krag. Aarden meanwhile is in a fit, abusing his bow, over its dreadful aim throughout the encounter.

Krag says the horses were killed in an earlier ambush by other members of his tribe, the Cragmaws. A dwarf and human were captured and taken to the tribal chief, a bugbear named Klarg.

The goblins have been on the lookout for the dwarf under orders of King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw Tribe. The King is allied with a figure known to the goblins only as "the black spider." The black spider wants to to acquire the dwarf's map to an old mine.

Krag doesn't know the location of King Grol, but points the party to his own lair about 1-2 hours beyond the brook. Asked to lead the way, he refuses, stating his goblin peers would kill him for certain.

Krag tells the party that the human, presumed to be Sildar, is being held at the lair by Klarg, but the dwarf and his map are already underway to King Grol, in hopes that his life will be spared.

Aarden's examinination of the dead horses reveals an empty map pouch, corroborating the goblin's claim.

The party discusses what to do next and decides to locate the nearby Cragmaw lair, rescue the captive and determine if the bugbear chief knows where their employer has been taken.

**Krag's Fate:** Asher and Aarden decide that Gar, having sustained the most injuries and the most kills, can decide Krag's fate. Aarden suggests leaving him tied up in the brush. Gar and Asher are concerned the goblin will interfere in the rescue attempt. Using his javelin, Gar quickly impales Krag after much begging and pleading for mercy. Aarden, distraught, reclaims his bloodied rope.

**Encounter Loot:** The party distributes the loot from the goblins. 15 gold, 8 silver b/t Asher, Aarden & Gar.

**Short Rest:** The party takes a short rest for Gar to recover from his injuries and Asher to regain his spell slots.

**Next Session:** Thursday, March 4. Payment to DM is due on Wednesday, March 3. See Discord for details.

**!!!**
- Players must keep track of loot distribution and update their own character sheet accordingly.
- Players are only permitted 2 short rests in a 24 hour period.
- XP will be evenly distributed to all players, including absent, to avoid mixed-level characters that will complicate encounters.

## Campaign Plot

![Image](/dnd-5e-phandelver-carousel.png)

More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power.

Then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.

For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine.

In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town and the Rockseeker brothers — a trio of dwarves — believe they have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave and intend to reopen the mines.
