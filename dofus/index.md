**Step into the World of Twelve** and its vast, lush landscapes, its gloomy moors, and its many treasures.

The streets of its cities are bustling with commercial (and criminal) activity... The wildlife is magnificent, the water is pure, the air is fresh and clean, and the earth is the most fertile you've ever seen... But underneath this idyllic surface, beware of traps...

Its edges are still uncharted... Especially since the Divine Dimensions, the worlds of the gods, opened up to the bravest adventurers.

**There are 18 classes to choose from.** Some are more suited to close combat, some prefer to attack from afar, and others focus on healing and protecting.
