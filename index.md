### DUNGEONS & DRAGONS 5E | OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN
## [The Lost Mine of Phandelver](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/lmop)

**Description:** More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver's Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave.

Then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.

For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine.

In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town and the Rockseeker brothers — a trio of dwarves — believe they have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave and intend to reopen the mines.
