### DUNGEONS & DRAGONS 5E

# "Lost Mine of Phandelver"<br />with DM Nicole

## Session 1 Recap
_Feb. 18, 2021 @ 12:30 to 2:30 PM_

**Participants:** Gar, Asher, Aarden. **Absent:** Tarkin, Joe.

- **Travel.** The party travels from Neverwinter by wagon for approx. 2 days, first south along The High Road, then east on Triboar Trail, headed for Barthon's Provisions in Phandalin to deliver supplies.
- Asher and Aarden helm the reins of the oxen pulling the wagon; Gar rides in the wagon with the supplies. After brief introductions, Asher & Aarden discuss the escort mission as Gar rummages through the supplies to determine what the group is transporting.
- **Introductions.** Asher is a researcher engrossed in the study of Fey magic. Aarden is tracking down a trio of tribes-people that have gone missing; the note is his only lead and is trying to determine Gundren's connection. Gar has been assigned to escort the supplies on behalf of his blacksmithing guild.
- **#Fail.** Gar discovers ale in the wagon's hold and attempts to imbibe some without being noticed by his companions. The attempt fails with both Asher & Aaden staring at him; Gar persists as if he'd gone unnoticed.
- **Roll20 Map.** The party reaches a 3-way intersection. West returns to Neverwinter; east continues to Phandalin; and south to Leilon. Two dead horses block the path to Phandalin. The party maneuvers the wagon to the side of the road and disembark to investigate. Several feet before the horses, splintered planks serve as a makeshift bridge for a tiny brook that passes by the intersection. Trees line both sides of the bridge, obscuring any sign of the goblin ambush.
- **Combat.** Four goblins ambush the party with surprise. Gar is flanked by two goblins and takes 3/4 damage from both. Asher is too far and manages to cast sleep on the other two. Aarden repeatedly (3x) tries to sharpshoot from range and misses. Gar cleaves both of his attackers with his axe. Asher vaporizes one of the sleeping goblins with his magic - splattering the remains all over Gar. Aarden uses hemp rope to restrain the last goblin, still asleep, for interrogation.
- **Interrogation of Krag.** The party interrogates the lone surviving goblin. Intimidated by Gar, the goblin divulges his name is Krag. Aarden meanwhile is in a fit, abusing his bow, over its dreadful aim. Krag says the horses were killed in an earlier ambush by other members of his goblin tribe.
- The dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and human Sildar Hallwinter were taken alive to his tribe's chief, the bugbear Klarg.
- Krag says the goblins of the Cragmaw tribe have been on the lookout for the dwarf under orders of their king, Grol. The king is allied with a figure known only as "the black spider" to acquire the Rockseekers' map.
- Krag doesn't know where the King is located, but points the party to his own lair about 1-2 hours beyond the brook. Asked to lead the way, Krag refuses, stating his fellow goblins would kill him. He tells the party that _Sildar_ is being held by Klarg, but _Gundren_ and map have been taken to the king.
- Aarden examines the dead horses to find an empty map pouch.
- The party discusses what to do next and decides to locate the goblin lair, rescue Sildar and determine if the goblin's chief  knows where Gundren has been taken.
- **Krag's Fate.** Asher and Aarden decide that Gar, having sustained the most injuries and the most kills, can decide Krag's fate. Aarden suggests leaving him tied up in the brush. The main concern is that Krag will interfere in their rescue attempt. Using his lance, Gar impales Krag after much begging and pleading for mercy. Aarden, distraught, reclaims his bloodied rope.
- **Loot**. The party distributes the loot from the goblins. 15 gold, 8 silver b/t Asher, Aarden & Gar.
- **Short Rest.** The party takes a short rest for Gar to recover from his injuries and Asher his spell slots.

**Next Session:** Thursday, March 4. Payment to DM is due on Wednesday, March 3. See Discord for details.

## Campaign Plot

![Image](/dnd-5e-phandelver-carousel.png)

More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power.

Then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.

For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine.

In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town and the Rockseeker brothers — a trio of dwarves — believe they have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave and intend to reopen the mines.
